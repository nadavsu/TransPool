TransPool, the ride sharing application. With TransPool, it has never been easier finding someone to ride with for work. Whether you are fed up with public transportation and looking for a way to reduce your commute time or if you want to cover your automobile fees each month. TransPool is the application for you!

*Current version only supports console user interface. Next updates will include a desktop and web-application.

### Running TransPool

- In order to start the application, run `java -jar ui.jar` from the terminal/cmd while in the location of the `ui.jar` file.
- Before using the application, a TransPool data file must be loaded to the system. The application will not let you do any other operations before that.
- To upload a TransPool data file, choose 1 in the main menu, then copy the **full** **path** of the file you would like to upload into the application and press ENTER. Make sure that the file type is `.xml`
- Example XML files can be found in the resources directory.
- After the step above is done, you can start using the TransPool application freely, just follow the instructions in the console.



### Important notes:

- The names of the stops are case sensitive.
- ui.jar and engine.jar need to be in the same folder for the application to work.
